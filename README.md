# Jules AI v47.0: The Autonomous Scientific Truth Ecosystem

Jules AI v47.0 is a self-governing, multi-agent platform designed for the production of verifiable scientific truth. It transcends simple content generation by integrating formal verification, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and blockchain provenance.

## New v47.0 Capabilities (Articles AQ-AZ)

- **🧪 AI-Powered Hypothesis Generator**: Proposes novel, testable hypotheses using DeepSeek-R1 for gap identification in the Unified Evidence Graph (UEG).
- **🔍 Automated Theorem Proving**: Parallelizes claims across Vampire, E, and Isabelle/HOL for machine-checkable rigor.
- **📊 Bayesian Deep Learning**: Principled uncertainty quantification using Pyro and TensorFlow Probability.
- **🔗 Blockchain Provenance**: Immutable publication records anchored to IPFS and Ethereum testnets (Article AT).
- **🎓 Personalized Research Assistant**: Adaptive user modeling and behavior-driven task recommendations.
- **✍️ AI-Assisted Collaboration**: Intelligent co-writing with semantic conflict prediction and UEG-grounded citations.
- **🖼️ Multi-Modal Evidence Fusion**: CLIP, DINOv2, Whisper, and Video-LLaMA integrated as first-class evidence.
- **⚙️ Scientific Workflow Composer**: Visual programming interface for complex research pipelines.
- **🚀 Adaptive Model Router**: Efficient, resource-aware model selection and distributed execution.
- **🔁 Automatic Failover**: Multi-cloud resilience using a distributed broker (Ray/Celery).

## Features

- **Autonomous Content Generation**: Produce scientific publications, presentations, animations, and more from high-level prompts.
- **Unified Evidence Graph (UEG)**: Queryable knowledge fabric integrating literature, reasoning, and proofs.
- **Multi-User Collaboration**: Real-time synchronization via Y.js and intelligent conflict resolution.
- **Universal Provenance**: Every artifact is wrapped in a ScholarlyObject with a verifiable blockchain anchor.
