## Abstract
This report explores the frontier of Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) and Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimization using the Jules AI v31.0 framework.

## Introduction
The integration of Tier 1 foundations into Tier 2 synergies represents a major advancement in autonomous scientific production.

## Tier 1: Hybrid Optimization
Leveraging CMA-ES and dual-metric adaptive convergence for robust variational quantum algorithms.

## Tier 2: Quantum Federated Learning
Distributed training across client nodes with privacy-preserving parameter aggregation.

## Tier 3: Domain-Specific Results
### Healthcare
Analysis of ECG-based datasets using QFL models.

### Finance
Portfolio optimization under high-volatility scenarios.

## Discussion
Strategic tool integration (MLIR/QIR) ensures maximum performance for complex hybrid workloads.
